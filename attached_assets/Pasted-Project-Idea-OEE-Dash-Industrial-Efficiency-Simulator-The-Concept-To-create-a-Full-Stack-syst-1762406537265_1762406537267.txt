Project Idea: "OEE-Dash: Industrial Efficiency Simulator"
The Concept: To create a "Full-Stack" system that simulates a factory operator reporting machine downtime on a tablet (the Front-end) and a manager analyzing these losses in a dashboard (the Back-end + Power BI).

OEE stands for Overall Equipment Effectiveness. It is the most important KPI in the manufacturing industry. By using this term, you immediately show that you understand the environment.

1. The "Shop Floor" (Front-end: Next.js or HTML/CSS/JS)
You will create a simple, clean, and responsive web interface (to simulate a factory tablet).

Page: "Line Downtime Reporting"

Fields:

A large button: "LINE DOWN" (Red).

When clicked, it opens a simple form:

Downtime Reason (Dropdown): "Mechanical Failure," "Material Shortage," "Tool Changeover (Setup)," "Electrical Maintenance."

Notes (Text field): "e.g., Roller X broke."

A button: "LINE UP" (Green).

Technology: You use Next.js (or pure React/JS) to capture this data and send it to your Back-end.

2. The "Server" (Back-end: Node.js)
Technology: You create a simple API using Node.js (with Express, for example).

Function:

Have a /api/downtime/start endpoint that receives the "Reason" and "Notes" and saves them to the database with a start timestamp.

Have a /api/downtime/end endpoint that receives the downtime ID and saves the end timestamp.

(Optional) Store this data in a simple database like SQLite or even a db.json file.

3. "Automation & Analysis" (Script: Python + Pandas)
Technology: This is where you shine with Python.

Function: You create a script (loss_analysis.py):

It connects to the database (SQLite/JSON) that Node.js populated.

Uses Pandas to read the data.

Calculates the total time for each downtime event (End - Start).

Groups the data and calculates:

Which reason had the most occurrences?

Which reason caused the longest total downtime? (e.g., "Setup" happened 3 times but totaled 200 minutes; "Mechanical Failure" happened 10 times but totaled 50 minutes).

Saves this clean analysis to a new .csv file named loss_report.csv.

4. The "Management Room" (Visualization: Power BI)
Technology: Power BI.

Function:

You open Power BI and import the loss_report.csv generated by your Python script.

You create a simple but impactful dashboard:

A Pareto Chart (the most important!) showing the "Top 5 Downtime Reasons by Time."

A Pie Chart showing occurrences by reason.

A "Card" with the Total Loss Time in minutes.

You take a high-quality screenshot of this dashboard.

How to Present it on GitHub (The "README.md"):
This is the key. Your project's README.md will be your cover letter.

Title: OEE-Dash: An Industrial Efficiency Simulator for Loss Reduction.

The Problem: "This project simulates a Digital Transformation solution for the shop floor, focusing on the collection and analysis of line downtime data—the primary driver of manufacturing losses."

Screenshots: Include the picture of the "tablet" screen (Front-end) and the "Management Dashboard" (Power BI).

Solution Architecture: (This is where you sell yourself)

Front-end (The Operator): Developed in Next.js, allowing for real-time downtime reporting.

Back-end (The Server): A Node.js API to securely collect and persist the data.

ETL & Analysis (The Analyst): A Python script with Pandas that processes raw data and transforms it into actionable insights on the root causes of losses.

Visualization (The Manager): A Power BI dashboard featuring a Pareto Chart, enabling management to focus on what truly impacts efficiency (e.g., "Mechanical Failure").

How to Run: (Simple instructions).
